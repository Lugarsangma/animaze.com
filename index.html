          <h2>Akaza</h2>
          <p>
            Akaza (猗あ窩か座ざ Akaza?) is a major supporting antagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
            He is a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the third highest position, Upper Rank 
            Three (上じょう弦げんの参さん Jōgen no San?).[3]

            Over a century ago, Akaza was a human by the name of Hakuji (狛はく治じ Hakuji?)[4], 
            a prodigious martial artist who trained under Keizo[5] while nursing his daughter, Koyuki,[6] 
            who would later become Akaza's fiancée.[7]
            Akaza is a very muscular young man of average height with skin so fair, 
            it appears bright green-tinged white, decorated by a pattern of thick blue lines, 
            which resemble the criminal tattoos he had as a human. Akaza had short, bright pink hair
             that fluffed out around his head, and inward-tilting yellow eyes with pink eyelashes and 
             blue sclera that looked somewhat like cracked glass. The kanji for "Upper Rank" (上じょう弦げん
              Jōgen?) and the daiji for "Three" (参さん San?) are etched into his irises as well. 
              The lines on his face curved through each of his eyes from below his ears to over his temples,
               another blue line running from the center of his hairline to the bridge of his nose, 
               with two more lines running around his neck, three others branching off the lower one 
               to his torso.

The center line ran directly down his chest to halfway down his stomach, and the other two 
branched off to the sides over each side of his chest to join the two other lines, this same 
three-line pattern there also repeating around his waist. On his arms there were lines running 
down the front of his shoulders that ran into two more, which went around his biceps, before 
continuing to run down to his wrists, below which it could be seen that each of his fingers are 
also dark blue with an orange fingernail, his toes also sharing this unusual appearance.
